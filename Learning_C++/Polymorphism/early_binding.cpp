    //ðŸ”¥ This is because it is early binding. pointer a is assigned to Apple class in compile time. and we know one class can't access other class member functions and attributes.

    //For the solution of this problem, we have late binding that assigns the return type of pointer at runtime not compile. if only pointer a was assigned as Iphone at [a = &i] it would work didn't it.
